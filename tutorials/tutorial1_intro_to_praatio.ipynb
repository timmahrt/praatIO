    "\n",
    "**PraatIO** or *Praat Input and Output* was originally conceived as a way to work with **Praat** from within python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Praat** ([http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/)) is a freely available tool for doing speech and phonetic analysis.  It has a spectrogram visualization tool with overlays of information like pitch track and intensity.  This visualization is paired with an editor for transcribing speech and for analyzing speech.  It also has tools for extracting acoustic parameters of speech, generating waveforms, and resynthesizing speech.  It is a comprehensive and indispensible tool for speech scientists.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The heart of any speech analysis is a transcript.  Praat calls its transcript files TextGrids, and the same terminology is used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, a TextGrid, used by Praat or PraatIO, is a collection of independent annotation analyses for a given audio recording.  Each layer of analysis is known as a tier.  There are two kinds of tiers: IntervalTiers and PointTiers.  **IntervalTiers** are used to annotate events that have duration.  Like syllables, words, or utterances.  **PointTiers** are used for annotating instaneous events.  Like places where the audio clipped.  The peak of a pitch contour.  Or the sound of a clap.  Etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Below is a sample textgrid as seen in Praat, with accompanying wavfile.*  In this example the textgrid contains two interval tiers and a point tier (named 'phone', 'word', and 'maxF0' respectively).  'phone' marks the phonemes--the consonants and vowels of the words.  'word' indicates the word boundaries.  And 'maxF0' marks the highest peaks of the pitch contour (the blue curve superimposed over the spectrogram) for each word.\n",

The TextGrid has a few properties defined--min and max times (the start and end of textgrid with respect to the audio file) and the number of tiers.  Then the tiers are presented in order of appearance.  They too have a few properties defined, followed by the intervals and points that they contain.  And thats it!\n",
